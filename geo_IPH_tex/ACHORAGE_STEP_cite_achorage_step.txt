\textbf{Anchorage step.} When partial information is available for specific regions and time points, such information can be incorporated as additional linear constraints of the form \( A\beta = y \), where \( A \) encodes the restriction matrix and \( y \) is a vector of known aggregates. This approach introduces a soft benchmarking mechanism. This anchoring procedure aligns with the benchmarking principle recommended by Eurostat, whereby regional accounts are adjusted to match national totals by incorporating aggregate-level constraints. See Eurostat Manual (2013)\cite{eurostat2013benchmarking}} that improves model identifiability and promotes coherence between national and regional estimates.
